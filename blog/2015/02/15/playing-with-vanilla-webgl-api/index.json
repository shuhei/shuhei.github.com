It took some time for me to understand concepts like array buffer and element buffer but it was fun to learn the basics that we stand on.</p>\n<p>The team behind <a href=\"https://github.com/stackgl/webgl-workshop\">webgl-workshop</a> creates a set of utility modules called <a href=\"http://stack.gl/\"><code>stackgl</code></a>. It embraces the UNIX philosophy, &quot;Write programs that do one thing and do it well.&quot; Even though the workshop doesn&#39;t use <code>stackgl</code> libraries, I liked the way the exercises were organized as small modules.</p>\n<p>Before moving to another workshop module, <a href=\"https://github.com/stackgl/shader-school\">shader-school</a>, I ported my old openFrameworks experiment with vanilla WebGL and Audio User Media in order to check if I could use what I learned so far.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blurred-cube\"><img src=\"/images/blurred-cube-webgl.png\" alt=\"Blurred Cube\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/blurred-cube\">Blurred Cube</a></p>\n<p>The hardest part was randomly moving the cube&#39;s edges. Because I couldn&#39;t randomly move vertices on the array buffer, I had to rewrite buffer data frame by frame. It might be inefficient, but it works well on my laptop at least.</p>\n<h2 id=\"steps-for-drawing-with-webgl\">Steps for drawing with WebGL</h2>\n<p>The exercises on <a href=\"https://github.com/stackgl/webgl-workshop\">webgl-workshop</a> split steps into two phases, <code>init</code> and <code>draw</code>, like <a href=\"https://processing.org/\">Processing</a>. Here I leave a note on general steps in them for later use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"init\">Init</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Compile shaders and link them into a program. If you have attributes in vertex shader, don&#39;t forget to set attribute location before linking. If you have uniforms, get their locations after linking for later use.</li>\n<li>Create buffers and assign data to them.</li>\n<li>Create element buffers and assign data to them if necessary.</li>\n<li>Create textures and assign data to them if necessary. You can use textures in fragment shader via texture unit number as uniform.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"draw\">Draw</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Use program, assign data to uniforms. If they don&#39;t change frame by frame, you can do this in the setup phase.</li>\n<li>Bind buffer. If you have only one buffer, you may have done this in the setup phase.</li>\n<li>Draw arrays or elements.</li>\n</ol>\n"}}
