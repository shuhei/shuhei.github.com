It is more relaxed than Tokyo and other big cities in Europe. Summer is especially nice. BBQ makes it even better. After my office moved to a building in front of Spree River, I enjoy my commute crossing Oberbaum Bridge and walking along the river.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travels\">Travels</h2>\n<p>I traveled more than ever. The destinations were Germany (Dresden, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, KÃ¶ln), Italy (Venice, Florence, Bologna), France (Paris), UK (London), Portugal (Lisbon) and Japan (Tokyo). I had fun in each of them, but if I have to choose one, I will name Lisbon. The city is full of what I miss in Berlin. Fresh and inexpensive seafood, views from hills, cute ceramic tiles, and beautiful weather. The sky was clear on every single day while I was there, and the highest temperature was 18 degrees in December!</p>\n<h2 id=\"beer\">Beer</h2>\n<p>I am glad to have found <a href=\"https://untappd.com/fuerstwiacekbrew\">Fuerst Wiacek</a>. Their <a href=\"https://untappd.com/b/fuerst-wiacek-german-movies/2155675\">German Movies</a> is my No.1 beer so far. <a href=\"http://biererei-berlin.de/\">Biererei</a> is a gem in Berlin, where I can buy fresh craft beers from Europe with growlers.</p>\n<p>British ale was a discovery to me. I liked pubs in London a lot. I also attended <a href=\"https://www.brlohack.de/english/\">the first craft beer hackathon in the world</a> and won 12 crates of craft beer...!</p>\n<h2 id=\"shopping\">Shopping</h2>\n<p>I bought <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com/\">an ergonomic keyboard</a> and <a href=\"https://billerbeck.info/en/products/82/neck-support-pillow-novum\">a neck support pillow</a>. Both of them lifted up my quality of life. My body is getting older.</p>\n<h2 id=\"language-learning\">Language Learning</h2>\n<p>I learned a bit of German Language. I finished A1 in May and started A2 after a pause of 5 months. While the learning process is prolonged, now German feels less cryptic to me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>I was lucky to join an awesome team. We work together and hang out together. <a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/\">A research at Google shows that psychological safety is a key to team effectiveness.</a> I feel it on my team.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, my team joined a relatively large project and completed it on time. I worked mostly in architecture, performance optimization, type checking with Flow, SRE, etc. for apps with React and Node.js. I also helped my colleagues to start building an internal tool with Elm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"side-projects\">Side Projects</h2>\n<p>I enjoyed working with Elm. I <a href=\"https://github.com/shuhei/elm-compare\">wrote a mobile weather app</a>, flew to Paris for <a href=\"https://2017.elmeurope.org/\">Elm Europe 2017</a>,  built <a href=\"https://github.com/shuhei/pixelm\">a mobile-friendly pixel editor</a> and <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/shuhei/building-a-pixel-art-editor-with-elm\">talked about it</a> at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Elm-Berlin/events/242852794/\">Elm Berlin Meetup</a>. I also helped <a href=\"https://github.com/w0rm/elm-glsl\">an experiment of its compiler-side</a> in Haskell, although it is still pending.</p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t do much with JavaScript for side projects but wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/shuhei/pelo\">a tiny library for server-side rendering with tagged template literals</a> while hanging out with friends at a cafe. It&#39;s used in <a href=\"https://github.com/choojs\">the choo ecosystem</a> now.</p>\n<p>Aside from building things, I learned monad transformers, etc. from <a href=\"http://haskellbook.com/\">Haskell Book</a> and machine learning with neural networks from <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning\">Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-then-\">.then()</h2>\n<p>After all, I lived a year in a new country and enjoyed it. I have settled down, and now I feel prepared for new challenges next year. Let&#39;s see what is going to happen!</p>\n"}}
