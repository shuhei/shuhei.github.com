It&#39;s the entry point of a package, which is exported when a client <code>require</code>s the package.</p>\n<p>Recently, I got <a href=\"https://github.com/shuhei/material-colors/issues/13\">an issue</a> on one of my popular GitHub repos, <code>material-colors</code>. It claimed that &quot;colors.es2015.js const not supported in older browser (Safari 9)&quot;, which looked pretty obvious to me. ES2015 is a new spec. Why do older browsers support it?</p>\n<p>I totally forgot about it at the time, but <a href=\"https://github.com/shuhei/material-colors/pull/10\">the <code>colors.es2015.js</code> was exposed as the npm package&#39;s <code>jsnext:main</code></a>. And to my surprise, it turned out that <strong><code>jsnext:main</code> shouldn&#39;t have <em>jsnext</em> or ES2015+ features</strong> like <code>const</code>, arrow function, class. What a contradiction!</p>\n<h2 id=\"jsnext-main\">jsnext:main</h2>\n<p>Module bundlers that utilizes tree shaking to reduce bundle size, like Rollup and Webpack 2, require packages to expose ES Modules with <code>import</code> and <code>export</code>. So they invented a non-standard property called <code>jsnext:main</code>.</p>\n<p>However, it had a problem. If the file specified <code>jsnext:main</code> contains ES2015+ features, it won&#39;t run without transpilation on browsers that don&#39;t support those features. But normally people don&#39;t transpile packages in <code>node_modules</code>, and many issues were created on GitHub. To solve the problem, people concluded that <code>jsnext:main</code> shouldn&#39;t have ES2015+ features other than <code>import</code> and <code>export</code>. What an irony.</p>\n<h2 id=\"module\">module</h2>\n<p>Now the name <code>jsnext:main</code> is too confusing. I was confused at least. People discussed for a better name, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module\"><code>module</code></a> came out that <a href=\"https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/jsnext:main\">supersedes <code>jsnext:main</code></a>.</p>\n<p>TODO: Node.js + ES Module discussion?</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-\">So?</h2>\n<p>I looked into a couple popular repos, and they seem to have both of <code>jsnext:main</code> and <code>module</code> in addition to <code>main</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/package.json\">redux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/package.json\">three.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this time, it seems like a good idea to have both of them if you want to support tree shaking. If you don&#39;t, just go with only the plain old <code>main</code>.</p>\n"}}
