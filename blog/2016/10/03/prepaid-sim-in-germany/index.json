I may or may not write about it later, but I&#39;m going to share more practical stuff today.</p>\n<p>Since I arrived in Germany, I bought two prepaid SIM cards and set up a SIM-free iPhone and a MiFi (mobile WiFi router). It was harder than I thought because I had never used a prepaid SIM before and most of official instructions were in German. I&#39;d like to share what I did for people like me.</p>\n<p>This post is a complement to <a href=\"http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Germany\">Germany | Prepaid Data SIM Card Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia</a>. If you haven&#39;t read it yet, read it first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-setup\">Initial setup</h2>\n<p>After reading the wiki, I chose <a href=\"https://www.o2online.de/\">O<sub>2</sub></a> as a network provider because of its rate and availability in Berlin&#39;s subway.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to a large electronics store like Saturn.</li>\n<li>Find an O<sub>2</sub> prepaid SIM.</li>\n<li>Bring it to an O<sub>2</sub> representative in the store and ask her to activate it.</li>\n<li>Go to the casher and pay for the SIM card.</li>\n<li>Insert the SIM card into your phone/MiFi. You can ask shop staffs to open SIM card slot.</li>\n<li>Unlock the SIM card. <strong>PIN is on the white card that contains the SIM card. Also its phone number (Rufnummer) is on the same card.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"topping-up\">Topping up</h2>\n<p>You can top up your SIM via a call, O<sub>2</sub> mobile app or O<sub>2</sub> website. I used O<sub>2</sub> website because I couldn&#39;t make a call with my MiFi and I don&#39;t have German AppStore&#39;s account. The website is only in German. So it&#39;s convenient to use Google Chrome&#39;s translation feature.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to a drug store chain like dm and buy one of O<sub>2</sub> top-up cards like €20. They are usually put next to other prepaid cards like Apple, Google Play, Amazon, Zalando, etc. <strong>The actual top-up code is printed on your receipt</strong>. Or you can buy a top-up code online at <a href=\"https://www.aufladen.de/en\">aufladen.de</a>. Thanks, Yan Yankowski for letting me know!</li>\n<li>Sign up for <a href=\"https://login.o2online.de/ngAuth/#/registration/mobile-registrierung\">O<sub>2</sub> website</a>.</li>\n<li>Enter your phone number (Mobilfunknummer), preliminary password (Vorläufiges Kennwort) and new password (Neues Kennwort). The preliminary password is notified via SMS. If it&#39;s for your MiFi, you can access to the MiFi&#39;s admin page and read SMS.</li>\n<li>Go to Recharge tab (Mein O<sub>2</sub> -&gt; Mein Prepaid -&gt; Guthaben &amp; Aufladen) and enter your top-up card&#39;s code.</li>\n<li>(Optional) Choose your favorite plan (Tarif &amp; SIM-Karte).</li>\n</ol>\n"}}
