Templates have been one of the places where mistakes are made since Angular 1. Even if we introduce TypeScript or lint tools, we couldn&#39;t be able to detect mistakes in templates until they are evaluated at the runtime.</p>\n<p>The steps would be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Angular 2 offline compiler compiles templates into TypeScript files with <code>.ngfactory.ts</code> extension.</li>\n<li>You prepare another bootstrap script that imports the root <code>.ngfactory.ts</code> and bootstraps your app with it.</li>\n<li>TypeScript compiler compiles the bootstrap script, other TypeScript files and <code>.ngfactory.ts</code> files into JavaScript.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The step 3 type-checks <code>.ngfactory.ts</code>, and detects typo and type errors in your templates if any. It is a great benefit in addition to skipping the runtime compilation and smaller library size. Looking forward to Angular 2 offline compiler&#39;s official release!</p>\n"}}
