I updated this website’s design and replaced its static site generator with Eleventy. Here are some notes about the new look and implementation details.

## Design

When I was reading a paper book, I realized that I liked serif fonts on it. I wanted use a serif font for my website as well. But I didn’t know which font to use. There are so many fonts in this world, and Google Fonts has tons of serif fonts. So, I used [a type pairing from Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/google-fonts-combinations)—Libre Franklin for headings and Libre Baskerville for body text.

For code blocks, I chose DM Mono. DM Mono is a monospace font commissioned by Deep Mind—yes, they have their own fonts. Its `f` has a fancy touch. I use it for coding these days after years with Fira Code.

```sh
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

This website has mostly text and a bit of images. Web fonts are the only luxury that it enjoys.

## Tech

I replaced my home-grown static site generator using gulp with Eleventy. I liked gulp—it was a good use case of Node.js streams. But I wanted to try something new. I picked Eleventy simply because I heard its name many times and it’s built with Node.js, which has a large ecosystem of web tooling.

Also, I removed Disqus and Google Analytics. This website is almost free of cookies now. The last one standing is Cloudflare’s bot detection cookie, which [will be removed in May 2021](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/).

## Implementation details

I took image optimization techniques from [google/elventy-high-performance-blog](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog)—next-gen image formats (AVIF and WebP), multiple image sizes (`srcset`), blurred placeholder with SVG, immutable image URLs, aspect ratio by setting `width` and `height`, lazy loading and async decoding. The implementation is rather wild. It parses each full HTML with `jsdom`, finds `<img>` tags, read and optimize linked image files, and replaces the `<img>` tags with optimized `<picture>` elements.

I implemented a funny feature that inserts `<wbr>` into longCamelCase words to break them on small screens. Some posts on this website have long titles such as “Check your server.keepAliveTimeout.” Those titles overflow on small screens. I could use a smaller font size for the titles, but I wanted to use a big font. [`<wbr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr) is an HTML tag that tells browsers, without inserting spaces, that they can break lines there. I created a template filter to insert it.

This website has a feature to generate Open Graph images—or Twitter Card images—using `node-canvas` for blog posts without any images. I used Eleventy’s pagination with `size: 1` to implement it. It’s a funny way to generate another file for each post in a collection.

Another thing worth mentioning is generating CSS as Eleventy’s global data. Based on a regular CSS file, I wanted to inline Google Fonts CSS at build time (and preload woff2 files in it), apply `postcss` to it for transformation and optimization, and finally embed it into each HTML file. [The quick tip to inline minified CSS on Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-css/) was not ideal for my use case because the same processing happens for each HTML file and I needed asynchronous processing. [Global data with JavaScript](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/#using-javascript-instead-of-json) provides flexibility and runs only once.

## Thoughts on Eleventy

I had a good experience with Eleventy. It’s easy to start with, and its data cascade is powerful. But it takes some time to understand the powerful data (and content) cascade. To implement features inherited from the previous version, I had to read most of the documentation in the end.

It’s not the best tool for someone who just wants to write blog posts out of the box. You’ll need to write some JavaScript. But if you want to have fun writing JavaScript, it’s a great option.
