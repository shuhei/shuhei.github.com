Hi, my name is Shuhei. I work as a software engineer in Zürich, Switzerland. When I’m not in front of my keyboard, I take a walk, go hiking, practice latte art or give a look at the spines of my book collection. I occasionally tweet at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shuheikagawa "Twitter @shuheikagawa") and put some hobby code at [GitHub](https://github.com/shuhei "GitHub @shuhei").

Opinions written here are my own and not views of my employer.
