Hi, my name is Shuhei. I'm a programmer based in Berlin, mostly writing JavaScript.

When I don't sit in front of my laptop, I wander around the streets of Berlin, give a look at the spines of my book collection, or enjoy local IPAs.

I occasionally tweet at [Twitter @shuheikagawa](https://twitter.com/shuheikagawa) and put some hobby code at [GitHub @shuhei](https://github.com/shuhei). You can check my professional profile at [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/shuheikagawa).
